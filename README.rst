webmention-basic
================

Trivial listener for `IndieWeb <http://indiewebcamp.com>`_ `webmentions <http://webmention.org>`_ in python. Simply receives and logs calls, does not implement verification, parsing, or anything else at all, really. If you want that, check out `Dainin <https://github.com/bear/dainin>`_ or `Ronkyuu <https://github.com/bear/ronkyuu>`_.
